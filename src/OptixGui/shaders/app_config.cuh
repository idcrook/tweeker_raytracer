// From the OptiX Header:
// Unless compatibility with SM_10 is needed, new code should use this define and rely on the new templated version of rtCallableProgram.
#define RT_USE_TEMPLATED_RTCALLABLEPROGRAM 1

// DAR Prevent that division by very small floating point values results in huge values, for example dividing by pdf.
#define DENOMINATOR_EPSILON 1.0e-6f

// 0 == Brute force path tracing without next event estimation (direct lighting). // Debug setting to compare lighting results.
// 1 == Next event estimation per path vertex (direct lighting) and using MIS with power heuristic. // Default.
#define USE_NEXT_EVENT_ESTIMATION 1
//#define USE_NEXT_EVENT_ESTIMATION 0

// // 0 == Do not compile in anything which is related to the built-in OptiX 5.1.0 DL Denoiser.
// // 1 == Compile in all code which is needed to run the DL Denoiser.
// //      This needs a lot of additional graphics memory by default. Search for "maxmem" to find how to limit that.
// //#define USE_DENOISER 1
// #define USE_DENOISER 0

// // 0 == Disable all code which creates and fills the albedo and the normal buffers.
// // 1 == Enable all code which creates, fills, and uses the albedo buffer.
// //#define USE_DENOISER_ALBEDO 1
// #define USE_DENOISER_ALBEDO 0

// // 0 == Disable all code which creates and fills the normal buffer. (Only possible when also using the albedo buffer.)
// //      NOTE: 0 is the default because the normal buffer in OptiX 5.1.0 is ignored!
// // 1 == Enable all code which creates, fills, and uses the normal buffer.
// //      Don't use! Just for demonstration how to generate the normals in camera space.
// #define USE_DENOISER_NORMAL 0

// 0 == Disable all OptiX exceptions, rtPrintfs and rtAssert functionality. (Benchmark only in this mode!)
// 1 == Enable  all OptiX exceptions, rtPrintfs and rtAssert functionality. (Really only for debugging, big performance hit!)
